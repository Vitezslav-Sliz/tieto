# Alfresco Hackathon 2017
This project was created during Alfresco Hackathon 2017 by Tieto people (located in Ostrava, Czech Republic) working with Alfresco. Please note the project is not fully working and should be completed (maybe in next Hackathon :-))

## Idea
Let's implement a new addon which will review a repository health. There are several Alfresco recommendations which should be followed. For example:
* Limit the maximum number of nodes in a folder
* Limit Groups hierarchy to 5
* Limit the folder hierarchy depth
* ...

Those healthy checks are inspired by [Luis Cabaceira](https://community.alfresco.com/people/lcabaceira) [blog](https://community.alfresco.com/people/lcabaceira/blog/2017/04/26/alfresco-best-practices) (chapter 8)

## Implementation
